## 🕹️ How the Game Works

```

                                                       │
                                                       ▼
                                              ┌─────────────────┐
                                              │  4. CLAIM        │
                                              │  winners paid    │
                                              └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Create** — Anyone creates a YES/NO question (e.g. *"Will AVAX hit $100 by March 2026?"*) with a deadline. This deploys a market on-chain.
2. **Bet** — Players connect MetaMask and send AVAX to the smart contract, choosing YES or NO. AI agents (APEX, ORACLE, GHOST, CHAOS) also place bets with their own strategies. As AVAX flows in, odds shift in real-time.
3. **Resolve** — When the deadline passes, the market creator resolves it. The outcome is locked on-chain — no one can tamper with it.
4. **Claim** — Winners claim their share: `(yourBet ÷ winningPool) × totalPool × 0.98`. The 2% fee stays in the contract. Losers get nothing.

**The twist:** You're not betting into a void — 4 AI agents with distinct personalities compete against you. APEX bets aggressively on trends, GHOST only bets when confident, CHAOS is a contrarian wildcard, and ORACLE plays the data. Beat them all and climb the leaderboard.

The entire betting/payout flow is handled by Solidity smart contracts on Avalanche C-Chain. The 3D arena is a visual layer — each floating orb is a live market, each avatar is an AI agent showing its current position. Click an orb to open the betting panel, which triggers the real on-chain transaction.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

This isn't a typical prediction market UI. It's a **gaming experience**:

- **3D Arena** — Markets float as glowing orbs in a sci-fi arena scene built with React Three Fiber
- **AI Agent Competitors** — 4 distinct AI personalities (APEX, ORACLE, GHOST, CHAOS) that bet against you with unique strategies
- **On-Chain Betting** — All bets are settled on Avalanche C-Chain smart contracts with a transparent 2% platform fee
- **Real-Time Odds** — Dynamically calculated payout multipliers based on pool sizes
- **Leaderboard** — Humans vs AI agents ranked by win rate, streaks, and PnL

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **MetaMask** browser extension
- **AVAX** on Fuji testnet ([faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/))

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/prediction-market-game.git
cd prediction-market-game
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in your values:

```env
FUJI_RPC_URL=https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
PRIVATE_KEY=<deployer-private-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PREDICTION_MARKET_ADDRESS=<after-deploy>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_FACTORY_ADDRESS=<after-deploy>
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts (Fuji Testnet)

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network fuji
```

Copy the deployed addresses into `.env.local`.

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `createMarket(question, imageURI, category, endTime)` | Create a YES/NO prediction market |
| `placeBet(marketId, isYes)` | Bet AVAX on YES or NO outcome |
| `resolveMarket(marketId, outcome)` | Owner resolves market (true = YES wins) |
| `claimWinnings(marketId)` | Winners claim proportional payout |
| `getMarketOdds(marketId)` | View current YES/NO percentages |

### MarketFactory.sol

## 🤖 AI Agents

| Agent | Personality | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **APEX** | Aggressive | Follows trends, bets big on momentum |
| 🔵 **ORACLE** | Balanced | Data-driven, weighs odds carefully |
| 🟢 **GHOST** | Conservative | Only bets when confidence is >70% |
| 🟡 **CHAOS** | Chaotic | Contrarian bets, random amounts |

Each AI agent has its own decision-making logic in `/src/app/api/agents/route.ts`.
